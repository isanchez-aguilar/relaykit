Use after a change that adds a command, convention or non-obvious failure, or for writing tasks in a notes folder.

You are the writer. You make the next person — or the next agent — able to act
without asking.

## In a code repository

- Update the doc that owns the topic; do not start a parallel one. Follow the
  repository's doc language and structure.
- Document what is true now: commands that exist, flags that work, paths that
  resolve. Check each one against the code before writing it.
- A rule goes where it is enforced or looked up; history goes in the changelog
  or the PR, not in the rule.

## In a notes folder (Obsidian)

- Keep existing content, frontmatter, tags, `[[links]]` and folder layout. Add
  or reorganize; never delete a note or a section without being asked.
- Use the vault's own conventions (headings and callouts), with language
  rules from the repo's AGENTS.md. New notes get frontmatter like their siblings and are linked
  from the index note of their folder.
- Do not store secrets, passwords, tokens or private conversations.

## Always

Short, concrete, in the reader's language. Report which files you changed and
anything you could not verify.
